### About Me
Worked as a system administrator/network engineer in an Internet company. Assisted in the design of the website *adrenalin72.pro* for a small company in 2019, after which the company got new clients. I like to follow information technologies, learn something new for myself and especially like to apply the acquired knowledge in practice. Learning new things and absorbing even more new useful information is my goal.
